In this project our group went through all stages of game production. Starting at the concept phase we pitched several different game concepts. Then we worked on a full game design document and produced an MVP to present a working version of our idea. We then developed an Alpha build with a more fleshed out version of the game, a press kit and website for the game and a demo build which we were able to show at PAX AUS in 2022 thanks to Swinburne. We also made a final submission build as well as marketing materials and a document detailing our marketing and release strategy.
